                <p>The World Health Organization has issued its first global guideline recommending GLP-1 therapies such as semaglutide and tirzepatide for long term treatment of obesity in adults. While the recommendation marks a shift in viewing obesity as a treatable chronic condition, WHO emphasized that medications must be combined with healthy diet and physical activity. The guideline is conditional due to concerns over long term safety, cost, and access and WHO warned that fewer than 10% of eligible individuals may have access by 2030.</p>

                <p>Micron announced it will withdraw from the consumer memory chip market to focus on advanced memory chips for AI and data centers, citing global shortages in semiconductors. The company will stop sales under its consumer brand Crucial at retailers and distributors worldwide, though shipments already committed will continue until February 2026. The decision reflects broader global supply chain stress and may lead to tighter availability and rising prices for flash memory in everyday devices like laptops and smartphones.</p>

                <p>The IMF has announced that its Managing Director will travel to China next week for the annual Article IV review of China's economy the first since mid 2024. The review comes amid ongoing global economic uncertainty, with trade tensions and shifting tariff regimes continuing to pressure export driven economies. Analysts say the results could shape global markets and investor sentiment, particularly in Asia, depending on IMF's findings and recommendations.</p>
